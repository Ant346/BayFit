# BayFit
This repository contains our official implementation of _A Bayesian Approach Toward Robust and Multidimensional Ellipsoid Fitting_ 
## Motivation
Ellipsoid fitting is an important foundamental problem, which has various applications in computer vision, computer graphics, and biomedical data analysis. Most existing approaches adopt the least-squares principle to find the target parameter. This manner generates satisfactory estimates under simple or clean scenes, but suffers from outliers and spatial dimensions. Unlike predecessor algorithms, we adopt the Bayesian parameter estimate process to solve this problem. Our method is ellipsoid-specific, robust against outliers, and can be generalized to high dimensional spaces.
